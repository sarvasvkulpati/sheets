    <h1>Lispread</h1>
    <p>This is an experiment by <a href="https://twitter.com/SarvasvKulpati/status/1399383517478359042">me</a> to create a spreadsheet, because I realised I didn't understand how they worked.<p>
      

    <p> Instead of an arbitrary language, I decided to use a lisp as the language for the formulas. At the moment, you can do + - * or /. You can also check out my learning logs <a href="https://learningtracker.vercel.app/SarvasvKulpati/projects/Spreadsheet%20from%20scratch%20in%20JS">here</a></p>

    <p> It's still hella buggy, but hey, I'm getting there. It's not everyday you try and build a spreadsheet from scratch.</p>
